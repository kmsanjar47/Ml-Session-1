There isn't a strict rule or universally agreed-upon threshold for what constitutes an imbalanced dataset. It's often context-dependent and can vary based on the specific problem, the nature of the data, and the goals of the analysis or model.  
  
However, a commonly used heuristic is the $80-20$ rule, where a dataset is considered imbalanced if the class distribution is roughly $80 \%$ to $20 \%$ or worse. In this case, the majority class would have around $80 \%$ of the samples and the minority class around $20 \%$.  
  
That being said, what's considered imbalanced can vary widely. In some cases, a class distribution of $60-40$ might be considered imbalanced, especially if the minority class is critical or costly to misclassify. In other cases, a distribution of 90-10 might be considered balanced, especially if the classes are naturally imbalanced in the real-world scenario to which the model will be applied.  
  
Ultimately, it's important to consider the specific domain, the implications of misclassifications, and the goals of the analysis when determining whether a dataset is imbalanced. Additionally, the choice of threshold might be influenced by practical considerations and domain expertise.
